 Automated Solution for Partitioning and Routing a VLSI Circuit in Java 
 
 This project was completed under the supervision of Dr. Sami Habib and Eng. Zainab Bahbahani in Kuwait University with the help of the peer engineers Dana Erdaini and Loulwah Alali.
 
 The project solves an optimization problem of designing a k-way partitioning and routing VLSI circuit, using a heuristic technique, which is the Simulated Annealing (SA). The problem requires minimizing the cut-set between partitions and maximizing the routing within each partition while keeping in mind a number of constraints.
